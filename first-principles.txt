problem: connecting djs to webradio stations is too technical.
	connecting:	connecting and broadcasting using dj program
		dj program: audio or stream
			stream: audio over http
		connecting: http
		broadcasting: setup of metadata
	djs: people operating audio machines
	webradio: third party audio over http
	too technical: fiddly, error prone, unreliable
		fiddly: lot of inputs
		error prone: easy to mistype, too hard to get right, risky
		unreliable: streaming is fallable, product of error prone

new problem: the setup of linking audio sources over HTTP is time intensive, requires practice, and fragile to maintain.
	time intensive: solved by convenience, reuse
	requires practice: solved by consistency, automation
	fragile to maintain: solved by managed solution

SOLUTION	
stream setup config package:
	fully encrypted or omitting passwords
	easy to parse by people 
	easy to parse by machines
	consistent
	automation
	vesion controlled
	easily reused though import export
web: 
	accessible universally
	visually manage streams
